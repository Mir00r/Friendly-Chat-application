Flutter is an open source SDK for creating high-performance, high-fidelity mobile apps for iOS and Android. The Flutter framework makes it easy for you to build user interfaces that react smoothly in your app, while reducing the amount of code required to synchronize and update your app's view.  Flutter makes it easy to get started building beautiful apps, with its rich set of Material Design and Cupertino (iOS) widgets and behaviors. Your users will love your app's natural look and feel, because Flutter implements platform-specific scrolling, navigational patterns, fonts, and more. You'll feel powerful and productive with Flutter's functional-reactive framework and our extremely fast hot reloads on devices and emulators.
